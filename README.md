# 🍊 Candy Crush in React  🍊
Having the similar project in JS, now I want to try code it in React and feel the diffrence :) Never enough of logic, of course.

On the front You can insert Your basic information - depending on Your number's start the background of the card (one among the three) is shown. What You put into proper input, at the same time appears on the card.

By when You start writing a CVV number, the front is switched to back. Amazing, is not? ;)
